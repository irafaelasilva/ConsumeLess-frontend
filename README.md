## ConsumeLess

In this project we are exposing the back-end via our api([ConsumeLess-Backend](https://github.com/irafaelasilva/ConsumeLess-backend)). Further to this, we create a new front-end that could interact with our back-end. As a team, we took this as an opportunity to learn and build our front-end with React, calling our restful API in order to access our data.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
